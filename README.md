# SDD-project

This was a project for the Software Design and Development course at Carthage College. Due to time constraints the code is messy and there are multiple bugs.

The purpose of the app is to be able to 'share' a directory on your phone with other nearby phones. After hosting a directory, other phones can connect using a QR code and then download files they want within that directory.
